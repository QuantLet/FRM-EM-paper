This repository implements the upHRP algorithm, the MinVAr portfolio, and the InvLamda portfolio.
The repository includes a code for the classical portfolio optimisation approaches (MinVar, IV, and HRP),
and another code for the Uplifted portfolio optimisation approaches upHRP and the InvLambda. 
The input data, as well as the output, are also provided.
Code for classical HRP is based on Lopez de Prado, M. (2018). Advances in Financial 
Machine Learning. Wiley. The code has been modified to create an uplifted portfolio
strategies based on FRM (Financial Risk Meter) adjacency matrices and it is adapted to be used with
python 3 and the data set.
